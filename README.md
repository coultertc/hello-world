# hello-world

Hello, Clayton here!
I am a big fan of strength-training, hiking, and exploring the world. I am new to github, and look forward to learning more and being a part of big projects!
Fun fact: I am the worlds biggest fan of donuts!
I am inspired and open to learning each and everyday.
Don't limit your challenges. Challenge your limits.
